# Vanessa D'Amario

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Fujitsu and a visitor affiliate 
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since November 2021. 
I joined MIT first as a PhD visiting student, then as a postdoctoral researcher. 
I got a PhD in computer science in May 2020. I previously graduated in physics (2015) 
and high energy physics (2016).

## My vision

The main goal of my career path is to build knowledge and instruments that contribute to improve humanity. 
Nowadays our society offers a rich variety of resources (in diagnostic, education, wellness) which are too often
available only to a very restricted set of people. I want to work towards the goal of reducing this gap and make 
technologies accessible to anyone.
In this regard, many reasons make me believe that the research I am doing today is going in the right direction.

To be more specific, I have been working at the edge of Machine Learning (ML) research  
and computational tools for neuroscience (clinical research).

What motivates my research in ML is that too often ML methods are inaccessible to many. 
Training such methods require high computational resources and very large amount of data, which not everyone has access to,
especially in countries with low income and poor research investments. 
Even when both are available, as it is often the case in Western countries, 
ML methods might suffer from bias. Due to the nature of current ML methods and their scarce interpretability,
this bias is hardly traceable to some factor in the data. 
In addition to this, data distribution shifts might reduce the predictive power of such tools on different populations than the
one used at training. All these factors reduce the usability of many ML methods. 
On purposely, I have not mentioned any specific application, because this holds for any dataset
coming from a data population with limited variety.
Fighting against such limitations and evaluating strategies to overcome poor predictive performance due to bias have constituted
a large portion of the time I have been spending at MIT. Despite being fundamental research in ML, 
I see clearly how the questions I am addressing today will help to envisioning better and more equal algorithms for tomorrow.

On the other hand, the use of computational methods in clinical neuroscience have represented an important part of my research interests.
The reasons of my excitement here are two-folds: first, computational methods help to accelerate scientific discoveries, which 
is quite amazing, given the complexity of the brain and how fascinating this organ is, second, findings in this context can
help clinicians to make better assessment, supporting them in clinical decisions, and suggesting new research treatments.
My work in this field has been mostly the fruit of the collaboration with the neurophysiologists at
Ospedale Pediatrico Istituto Giannina Gaslini di Genova 
https://www.gaslini.org/ (Genoa, Italy), one of the most prominent research centers and children clinics in Europe.
In this context, I see computational tools and ML as a great opportunity to actively help society and improve people's lives.

In the following there more broadly and concisely a map that motivates in my opinion the research in intelligence. 
I see at least three main motivations that drive this research, and I am curious of the many more that you can think of!
All of them have strong intersections and provide inspirations and tools to one another.
